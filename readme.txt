Easy embedding of videos for the Ooyala Video Platform. Ported from jovelstefan's excellent embedded video plugin.

== Installation ==

Copy the subfolder "ooyala-video-browser" with all included files into the "wp-content/plugins" folder of WordPress. Edit the file called ooyalaajax.php and change the lines at the top to use your Backlot pcode and secret code. Save this file. You will find your pcode and secret code under Account -> Developers in Backlot.

Then go to the menu "Administration" > "Plugins" and activate it. 

== Screenshots ==

1. A new toolbar button is available to launch the Ooyala Search and Insertion GUI.
2. The Ooyala GUI allows you to search and insert videos from your Ooyala account. You can search by keyword or choose the last 8 videos uploaded to the account.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =
* Added screenshots to package for SVN. No other changes made.

== Configuration ==

The configuration options are simple and do not need explanation. See the administration panel of the plugin in your WP admin frontend.
