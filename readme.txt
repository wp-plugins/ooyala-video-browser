Easy embedding of videos for the Ooyala Video Platform.

== Installation ==

Copy the subfolder "ooyala-video-browser" with all included files into the "wp-content/plugins" folder of WordPress. Edit the file called ooyalaajax.php and change the lines at the top to use your Backlot pcode and secret code. Save this file. You will find your pcode and secret code under Account -> Developers in Backlot.

Then go to the menu "Administration" > "Plugins" and activate it. 

== Configuration ==

The configuration options are simple and do not need explanation. See the administration panel of the plugin in your WP admin frontend.
