Connect your Ooyala account to embed and upload assets directly from WordPress.

== Description ==


The Ooyala Wordpress Plugin is specifically designed to take advantage of the many new capabilities of the latest versions of Wordpress platform and to give publishers a more updated look and feel. 

The plugin harnesses the existing media manager backbone infrastructure to create a seamless integration of a user's Ooyala assets within the media manager. It lets you create posts with assets from your Ooyala account – even uploading new videos – without ever leaving your WordPress site.

Key Features:

* Easy to embed a specific video into your post/page.
* Ability to search by Title, Description, embed code and also refine results by labels. 
* Upload in the background and notify the user when the video is finished processing so the user can embed the video.
* Easily manage video labels from the video browser.
* Support for the Ooyala Player V4 as well as additional options for the V4 player on the settings screen.
* Full backwards compatibility with Player V3.
* Allow JavaScript player parameters to be modified by an 'ooyalaParameters' function defined in the global JavaSvcript namespace.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either by uploading it via FTP or by using the "Add Plugin" function of WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page.
3. Enter your Ooyala API credentials on the Settings >> Ooyala Options.
4. Select the player version you wish to use.

Using the plugin once installed:

1. Go to a new or existing post.
2. Select "Embed Ooyala" above the composition area, or access Ooyala from the Media tab.
3. Search for assets by Title, Description, or Embed Code.
4. Select your desired Player Display options and insert the embed shortcode.
5. Upload new videos straight to your account via the upload tab.
